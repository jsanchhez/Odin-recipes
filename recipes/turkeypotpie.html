            <li>1 cup sliced celery</li>
            <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper            </li>

        <h2 class="directions">Step to Follow in Order:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place frozen peas, carrots, and beans in a saucepan with celery; add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until celery is tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>While the vegetables are simmering, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add flour, salt, pepper, celery seed, onion powder, and Italian seasoning and whisk until a paste forms, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in chicken broth and then milk until incorporated; bring to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove thickened sauce from the heat; add cooked, drained vegetables and cubed turkey and stir until filling is well combined.</li>
            <li>Set out two 9-inch pie dishes. Fit one pie pastry into the bottom of each dish. Spoon 1/2 of the pot pie filling into each dish, then lay the remaining pie pastries over top. Pinch and roll the top and bottom pastries together at the edges to seal. Use a sharp knife to cut several small slits in each top pastry to allow steam to release while cooking. Place pies on baking sheets.            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Check the top crusts for browning; if they are browning too quickly, cover with aluminum foil. Continue to bake until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 15 to 20 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
